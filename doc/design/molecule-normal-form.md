# Representation of Molecules

The internal representation format of molecules incorporates
information from both the input MDL `.MOL` V2000 format data, and the
additional information that **RxnWeaver** needs and updates throughout
the retrosynthesis process.

**_N.B._** _We do **not** provide compatibility with MDL's V3000
  format (`.MOL` or any other) files._

## Atoms

Each atom knows its element, current valence configuration, if it is
an isotope of its element, any residual charge on it, the number of
(explicit and implicit) hydrogen atoms attached to it, its spatial
coordinates, its neighbours, the specific bonds with them, _etc_.

Atoms have a normalised form to which they are converted after the
entire molecule is read and validated.  The process of normalisation
involves multiple steps, the most important of which are described
hereunder.

Each atom is assigned a priority building on the standard
**Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP)** rules, authoritatively described in
*R.S. Cahn, C.K. Ingold and V. Prelog, Angew. Chem. 78, 413-447
(1966), Angew. Chem. Internat. Ed. Eng. 5, 385-415, 511 (1966); and
V. Prelog and G. Helmchen, Angew. Chem. 94, 614-631 (1982),
Angew. Chem. Internat. Ed. Eng. 21, 567-583 (1982)*.

Since CIP rules are specifically for determining stereo
configurations, they are usually applied in stereo sites (chiral
atoms, stereogenic bonds, _etc_.).  In our case, priority is assigned
to each atom of the molecule, irrespective of whether it is involved
in a stereo configuration or not.  This priority is computed based on
a compound value including the atom's own atomic number and those of
its neighbours listed in descending order of atomic numbers.

### Calculation of Normal IDs

A simple way to determine the normalised IDs of atoms is described
here.

1. For each atom, construct a `struct` with the input ID of the atom,
   and a tuple of a fixed length of 21 (1 for the current atom + 20
   for the maximum number of expanded neighbours to take into account,
   as per InChI's treatment).
1. Initially, fill the tuple with zeroes.
1. Put the current atom's atomic number in the first position of the
   tuple.
1. Put the atomic numbers of the neighbours in the following
   positions, in descending order of their atomic numbers.  When
   multiple neighbours with the same atomic number exist, their order
   does not matter.
1. Repeat the neighbour twice for a double bond, and thrice for a
   triple bond.
1. Once such `struct`s are constructed for all atoms, sort those
   `struct`s on the tuple in each of them.  Two tuples are compared
   element by element, in order, from left to right.
1. The new order of the `struct`s gives the normalised IDs of atoms,
   counting from `1` rather than `0`.

### Adjacency Lists

Information about neighbours is stored as an adjacency list.  Double
and triple bonds are taken into account by repeating the neighbour as
many times.  The neighbours in the list are sorted in ascending order
of their normalised IDs.

For ease of look up, adjacency lists are full: if atom **A** is a
neighbour of atom **B**, the adjacency list of **B** lists **A**, and
_vice versa_.  However, due to the CIP priorities mentioned, their
respective indices may be different.  This repetition does waste some
space, but is very convenient when accessing and traversing
neighbours.

## Bonds

Each bond represents the chemical bond between exactly one pair of
atoms.  It records the bond order, as well as stereo information
should it be applicable.

In a given molecule, we should never have more than one bond
connecting the same pair of atoms.

*N.B. We do not use InChI's provision to store stereo information
 relative to the second atom.  We always store stereo information of a
 bond relative to the first atom.*

In addition, each bond tracks if it is aromatic, if it participates in
any rings, which rings it participates in if so, if it is in a chain
linking two separate ring systems (that belong to the same connected
component), _etc_.

## Rings

Each ring maintains a list of the atoms comprising it, the bonds
comprising it, other rings that neighbour it (_i.e.,_ they share at
least one atom or bond with the current ring), if it is aromatic,
_etc_.

Once a ring is constructed, it is effectively frozen.  Altering it in
any way results in its destruction.  The only way to alter a ring into
a different ring, is to create a new desired ring.

In its normal form, a ring stores the normalised IDs of its atoms
starting with that having lowest normalised ID (or, equivalently, the
the highest priority).  The other atoms are, of course, in the order
in which they form the ring.

## Ring Systems

A ring system represents a set of physically fused rings.  The fusion
can have exactly one atom as the common atom of the involved rings
(spiro), one bond in common between any given pair of rings (normal),
or more than one bond in common between at least two rings (involves
bridges).

Unlike a ring, a ring system is not frozen, and can change during the
course of the life of a molecule.
