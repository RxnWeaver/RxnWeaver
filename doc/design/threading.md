Threading
=========

The construction, analysis and transformations of any given molecule should be within a single thread whenever possible.

The following scenarios describe the notable exceptions.

Bulk-processing
---------------

As the input representation of a molecule is read, a factory constructs the in-memory molecule.  When bulk-processing molecules, the input text is read by a dedicated reader thread, while batches of input molecules are processed by separate worker threads.

Retro-synthesis
---------------

In the case of a single goal molecule being tried for retro-synthesis, each candidate reaction can be tried in a new thread.  Since the above can apply to an arbitrary intermediate molecule too, for efficiency, a pool of workers handles the generation of reactants for product molecules.

In order to facilitate the above, a queue of product molecules is maintained by a master thread.  Whenever a worker thread becomes available, it picks up the next molecule to be processed off the said queue.
