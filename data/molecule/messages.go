// InMessage is a message sent to a molecule by an external agent.

// An in-message comprises a request, an optional cookie value and a
// dynamic payload.  The meaning of the cookie depends on the request,
// but usually represents a request ID.  Similarly, the actual
// contents of the payload depend on the request.
//
// Each request also includes the channel over which the result
// message has to be transmitted.  This enables the molecules to
// operate in a stateless manner, as far as the communication is
// concerned.
//
// Thus, it is highly imperative that other agents that correspond
// with a molecule be aware of what requests molecules understand, and
// what payloads are to be delivered as part of the message.
